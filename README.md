## Overview


### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person


### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

- Just a basic top down flow working through the HTML and getting the CSS to look they way we needed it to and the JavaScript to calculate correctly.


### Built with

- Simple HTML5
- Simple CSS
- Simple JavaScript
- It was my goal to just 'brute force it' so I learn how they interact.


### What I learned

- Implemented some responsive CSS, good to see it in action.
- Writing up the JavaScript was a lot of fun and figuring how to read the data from the html, manipulate it and write it back.
- It was a challenge working with variables that are not strongly typed.


### Continued development

- Thinking about it...


### Useful resources

- www.w3schools.com - Always a helpful resource.

## Acknowledgments

No Acknowledgments yet worth mentioning except for Frontend Mentor.  Thanks for this challenge and it taught me a lot on apply CSS.  This is basically the first one I have done on my own so a big learning curve.
